# Encoded text file parallely using Alchemi 

I'm Long. This is my project in Parallel Computing subject at term 20202, Hanoi University of Science and Technology.<br />
Another creators: Hung Do Quang.

Problem: Read a text as `input.txt` file, execute the function `洧녭(洧논)=2洧논+1`, where 洧논 is the ASCII code character of each character in the `input.txt` file and print the corresponding ASCII code character `洧녭(洧논)` output file `output.txt`. Request, split the `input.txt` file into `洧녲` threads (`洧녲` input from the keyboard), according to the size of the `input.txt` file to perform on the nodes in the calculation grid.
